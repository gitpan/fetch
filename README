# Usage     : fetch.pl SWISS_ENTRY
#
# Function  : fetches swissprot entry or fasta format seq with
#             given seq name(like  SAA_HORSE, SA*HORSE, SAA,..)
#             you can give multi files(SAA*, SAU*) at the same
#             time. This uses ENV setting of 'SWDIR'.
#             If you already know where you put seq.dat you can
#             specify in the prompt.  jong@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk

# Example   :  fetch.pl YAPT, fetch.pl *YEAST

# Options   : _  for debugging.
#             #  for debugging.
#             -f for fasta format file output
#             -a is for ALL matched seq. (same as using glob=> *YEAST)
#             -c is for Creating seq.idx file
#             -h is for HELP!
#             -g is for GDF file format output
#             -l is for list of match entries(in 1 column)
#             -s is for species option (input name mst be species (YEAST, RAT, HUMAN..)
#             n= is for Number of seq you want to get from swissprot
#             s= is for Size limit. Min seq size in swiss, s=10  -> minimum 11 aa seq.
#             S= is for Size limit. Max seq size in swiss, s=1000 -> get less than 1000
#
# Returns   : STDOUT
# Argument  : swissprot seqname
